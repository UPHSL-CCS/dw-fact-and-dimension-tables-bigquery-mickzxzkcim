# Data Warehouse Modeling: Baby Name Popularity Analysis ðŸ‘¶

This project demonstrates a fundamental data warehousing workflow using Google BigQuery. We build a **Star Schema** to analyze USA baby name popularity from the 2000s, addressing a business problem for a fictional retailer, **BrightBeginnings**.

The primary goal is to identify the **Top 5 most popular male names for each state** from 2000 to 2009 to inform inventory and marketing strategies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Problem

* **Organization:** BrightBeginnings, a national baby-products retailer.
* **Goal:** Plan state-level inventory and marketing for the 2000s by aligning product lines (e.g., personalized items, name-printed SKUs) with the most popular baby names.
* **Need:** Identify the Top 5 male names per state in the 2000s and understand how popularity shifts by year to inform state-specific product assortments and seasonal campaigns.
* **Success looks like:**
    * A ranked list of the Top 5 male names for each state (2000â€“2009).
    * Counts of births to size inventory appropriately per state.
    * The ability to easily slice data by state, year, and gender using the star schema.

## ðŸ“Š Data Model: The Star Schema

This project uses a star schema, a classic data warehouse design that separates data into a central **Fact table** (containing quantitative measurements) and surrounding **Dimension tables** (containing descriptive context).

* **`fact_names` (Fact Table):** Contains the core measurable eventâ€”the number of births for a given name, in a specific year, state, and for a specific gender.
* **`dim_time` (Dimension Table):** Provides temporal context like year and decade.
* **`dim_state` (Dimension Table):** Provides geographical context, including state codes and categories.
* **`dim_gender` (Dimension Table):** Provides descriptive labels for gender.

This design optimizes queries for analytics and reporting.

## ðŸš€ How to Run this Project

To replicate this analysis, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have a Google Cloud account with access to the BigQuery Console.

2.  **Create a Dataset:** In your BigQuery project, create a new dataset named `class_dw`.

3.  **Run the SQL Scripts:** Execute the code blocks below in the specified order.

    > **Important:** In each script, you must replace **`PROJECT_ID`** with your actual Google Cloud Project ID.

---

### 1. Create the Fact Table (`fact_names.sql`)

This script creates the central fact table containing the core birth count measures.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `PROJECT_ID.class_dw.fact_names` AS
SELECT
  INITCAP(LOWER(name)) AS name_standardized,
  gender,
  UPPER(state) AS state_code,
  year,
  number AS births_count,
  DATE(CONCAT(CAST(FLOOR(year/10)*10 AS STRING), '-01-01')) AS decade_start
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013`
WHERE name IS NOT NULL AND number > 0;
